# Iynaix's NixOS Config

This config is intended to be used with NixOS.

## Features

- Multiple NixOS configurations, including desktop, laptops and VM
- Persistence via impermanence (both `/` and `/home`)
- Automatic ZFS snapshots with rotation
- Flexible NixOS config via feature flags
- sops-nix for managing secrets
- Hyprland / niri with waybar setup, with screen capture
- Dynamic colorschemes using wallust (pywal, but maintained)

## How to Install
Run the following commands from a terminal on a NixOS live iso / from a tty on the minimal iso.

The following install script partitions the disk, sets up the necessary datasets and installs NixOS.

From a standard ISO,
```sh
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iynaix/dotfiles/main/install.sh)
```

From the custom iso built via `nbuild-iso ISO_HOST`,
```sh
iynaixos-install
```
Reboot

```sh
# the rename is needed for encrypted datasets, as -F doesn't work
sudo zfs receive -o mountpoint=legacy zroot/persist-new < SNAPSHOT_FILE_PATH
sudo zfs rename zroot/persist zroot/persist-old
sudo zfs rename zroot/persist-new zroot/persist
```

## System Rescue
Run the following commands from a terminal on a NixOS live iso / from a tty on the minimal iso.

The following script optionally reformats the boot partition and / or /nix dataset, then reinstalls NixOS.

From a standard ISO,
```sh
sh <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iynaix/dotfiles/main/recover.sh)
```

From the custom iso built via `nbuild-iso ISO_HOST`,
```sh
iynaixos-recover
```

## Adding a New Host
NOTE: This can be done all within the live iso with a git clone but it's easier to do it on a system with a development environment already setup.

Create a new directory in `hosts/` with the new hostname, in the same format as the other hosts.

Boot into the live iso on the new system and run `nixos-generate-config --no-filesystems --show-hardware-config`.

Copy the output onto a pastebin or similar, replacing `hosts/NEW_HOSTNAME/hardware.nix` with the pastebin contents, preferably on the other system.

Push the updated config to git, then proceed with installation using the instructions from [How to Install](#how-to-install) above.
